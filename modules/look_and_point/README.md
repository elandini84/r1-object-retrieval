# look_and_point

Just a simple module which receives an input Bottle in the form `<object> (<object coordinates>)` and returns as output a Bottle containing just the object coordinates.
This module is used to transform the output from modules goAndFindIt and lookForObject in the format used as input by module handPointing.
